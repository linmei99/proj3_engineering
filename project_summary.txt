Abstract:
Competitive analysis is an important part of Business Intelligence. If small business owners have choices, which business area should they go into? Where should  open their first business, or to expand their existing business?  To answer this question, we must know more about the competitive landscape, based on the industrial type of the business, and the area in general. 

This project is to provide an overview of the competitive landscape, searchable for different business area in the city of Chicago. It allows the user to select from a drop down list of several hundred possible business activity and license code, and gives a summary of the industry over the years. It covers the number of business over the years, the turn over rate. It also provides a list of the leaders in the business, their number of years in business and their geographic locations.  

Data:
The primary data are acquired through Chicago open data portal, using Socrata open data API to obtain the current active business licences, and all the previous business licenses going back to year 2002. This is an active database updated daily. After the app is build, it can be updated through the app to pull in the most recent information to aid in the analysis.

There are a total of over 1 million business licenses in this dataset. There are a small number of licenses from before 2003, but it is highly incomplete. So the industrial wide analysis only starts from year 2003.

There are over 50,000 active business license, covering more than 400 different business activities. 

The raw data received over the API are in json format, and will be stored in a MongoDB.
 
Algorithms:
The data has many missing data points. About 1% of the license has the address listed outside Chicago, some as far as Miami. So only business with address in the city of Chicago are included in the final summary. Some have missing GPS data, and will be filled with center of Chicago for mapping purpose.

There is a license code for every license, but it could be a general business license, and provides little utility to identify what the business is actually doing. The business activity field are often missing in the early periods, and more than 50% of the licenses before 2010 do not have the business aera identified. Even in year 2020, there are still about 10% of licenses missing the field. 

A business could have multiple licenses over the years, and renew the licenses every few years. Their data will be consolidated into a new business database entry covering the entire period. This prevents double counting of the same business. 

Some license have expiration data earlier than the license start data, likely data entry error. They are counted as valid for 1 month at the start only. 

Some licenses appear to be back dated, starts in 2008 expires in 2009 but have date when license was issued in 2010. They are counted but are suspect, so results could be misleading. 

 

The streamlit app is running off prepared data, which is generated via an init() function. Update the underlying database can be done via this init() function. When pulling the historial license info, there is a rate limit in the number of request per hour, so the waiting time for the remote server to responde is long. Refreshing the data can take a long time if the remote server is applying rate limits.

The mongoDB is too big to be included in the repo, so the app can be run only from the local machine where the DB is properly built. 

Tools:

Database used is MongoDB. Data is acquired through Socrata open data API, in json format. A steamlit application run for the presentation. 

In this MVP, the summary info can be provided for a given business code. The method for user to select the code from a list is to be provided in the Streamlit app later on. 

Results:
1. The StreamLit app allows the user to select either a license code, or a business activity to fine tune the type of business he/she may wish to examine. 

2. For each category, a summary gives the number of active business in this category, and their average time in this business. The same data is also provided for all business in this category, past and present.

The turnover, the number of past versus present business can be seen from this. 

3. The number of business in this category from 2003 to present is plotted to show the general trend in this business. The number of license remain active up to 6 months in the future is plotted to indicate renewal trend, or risk of non-renewal. 

4. A map showing the location of all currently active business is provided. This can provide valuable info to business coverage, and competitive landscape.
 
5. A more detailed information list of up to 10 business with the longest tenture is also provided for further competitive analysis.
